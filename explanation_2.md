# Problem 2: File Recursion

Worst-case time complexity is **_O(n)_**.

The time-complexity for this program is **_O(n)_** because that is to iterate all files from starting path and under directories of starting path for finding right file path.

The space-complexity is **_O(n)_**.

The call stack accumulates until we check the files in the lowest directory. So, space-complexity is **_O(n)_**.
